The hydrophone was positioned on the HTP in front of the whale. The geometry of this arrangement was such that the hydrophone and the whale's ears were along the base of a downward-pointing equilateral triangle and were the same distance(2.24 m) from the projector 2 m below the HTP (Fig. 6). A preamplifier (BrÃ¼el & Kjaer 2635) on the HTP was used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio along the 400 m of cable connecting the HTP to the computer (Fig. 4A). On the surface, a TDT module converted the analog signal to a digital signal. The sampling rate was 500 kHz and the sampling window was 2 s. The digital signals we retransferred to the computer through the fiber-optic interface and then saved on computer disk together with files containing system settings and all other information pertinent to the current session.
